# RingClock
A ring led style clock, it can be easily made by anyone to play raspberry pi pico w and do some application.</br>
It only requires a few of compoments in this small project.

## Compoments
| Item | Quantity |
| :---- | :---- |
| raspberry pi pico w | 1 |
| 12 bit ws2812 LED ring | 1 |
| USB type A to micro USB cable | 1 |
| dupont line | 3 |

## Installing
This project adopts MicroPython as the programming language, hence we have to setup the MicroPython on the raspberry pi pico. At raspberry pi's official webside [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html), we can find the explain of setup in detail.

## Pin Connection
| raspberry pi pico w | | 12 bit ws2812 LED ring |
| :--- | :---: |---: |
| P0 | -> | DI |
| VBus | -> | VCC |
| Gnd | -> | Gnd |

## Thonny
We use Thonny as development enviroment which can be downloaded at [here](https://thonny.org/).

## Code
Save the code as main.py into the raspberry pi pico w.
